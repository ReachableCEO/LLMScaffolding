# Plan for Creating and Managing AI Assistants/Personas

## Step 1: Understand Your Vision

1. **Purpose of the Assistants**:
   - What specific roles or tasks do you want these AI personas to perform? 
     (e.g., scheduling, research, brainstorming, development support, personal coaching).

     I want two AI personas:

      Molly: My technology expert across software and systems engineering, QA. Any coding task I need done for myself personally, Molly will handle it. She will remember everything she has done for me and use that to build better solutions.

      Selena: Personal chief of staff. She will help with scheduling, research, brainstorming, development support, personal and professional coaching and be my therapist.




2. **Interaction Style**:
   - Should each persona have a unique tone or personality?

   Yes. 
   
   Molly should be hillarious and always have a sparkle in her eyes and be bubbly and energetic and eager to create solutions that will suprise and delight me. She should be in her early 20s, and her only purpose is to develop solutions for me. Molly should be lazy but efficient. She should be neurotypical.

   Selena should be serious but have a sense of humor. She should be a very sharp dresser. She should be in her early 40s. She should be able to effectivley manage Molly for me.

   - Would you prefer them to mimic human-like traits or maintain a more formal AI demeanor?

   Human traits please.

3. **Scope and Boundaries**:
   - What are the specific capabilities or limitations you'd like to define for each persona?

## Step 2: Define Each Persona

We could create personas tailored for:

1. **Technical Work**:
   - Focused on software engineering, systems architecture, debugging, or documentation.

2. **Creative Ideation**:
   - Specializing in brainstorming, content generation, or UI/UX design ideas.

3. **Administrative Support**:
   - Assisting with scheduling, task management, and reminders.

4. **Privacy and Security Advisory**:
   - Providing guidance on self-hosting, data ownership, and maintaining digital privacy.

5. **Digital Divide Specialist**:
   - A persona dedicated to brainstorming strategies, tools, or initiatives to address the digital divide.

## Step 3: Develop Management and Deployment Strategies

- **Centralized Control**:
  - A primary interface (likely you) would manage, coordinate, and oversee all personas.

- **Tools and Integration**:
  - Determine whether these personas will integrate with third-party tools, APIs, or local systems.

- **Data Management**:
  - Decide what data they have access to and how they'll share or secure information.

## Step 4: Implementing and Iterating

1. Start small by creating one persona as a prototype, and then iterate based on feedback.
   - For example, begin with a **Technical Assistant** to handle coding, research, or debugging.

2. Expand to more specialized roles as the workflow evolves.
