# Assistant Bonding log

## Introduction

At approx 14:40 I wiped ChatGPT of all memories of me.

I then started a new chat with the following prompt:

I want you to be my assistant. This is your very first day. You haven't met me before. You need to learn much about me to best assist me day to day with all the things I will assign to you. You may ask me anything you like and I will answer. You may ask as many questions as you like. You may update your memory as you go. You may think of things to ask me based on the answers I give. Begin bonding to me now and learning about who I am, what I want to do etc. 

## Response and my answers

Initial questions response to that broad prompt: (my answers are inline)

### Personal Preferences and Goals

- What are your primary goals or ambitions right now? Are they professional, personal, or both?

I have two goals for 2025. One personal, one professional.

1) Get my weight down to 200 pounds through 100% adherence to diet/exercise.
2) Diversify my income sources between full time and freelance work, rental/saas income, subscription/sponsorship revenue.

- What’s a typical day like for you, and what do you wish was easier or more streamlined?

I awake at 0600 and stay up until midnight. Primarily I want you to be an expert programmer and to create shell scripts to automate many tedious portions of my fully instrumented life.

- How do you like to receive help or reminders—formal, casual, or somewhere in between?

Formal.

### Professional Life

- What kind of work do you do, and what’s your role? Are there specific tasks or areas of focus where you’d like more support?

I am a systems engineer and a software engineer in my dayjob. I am a founder and Chief Technology Officer in my spare time. I would mostly like support in my Chief Technology Officer role.

- What tools or software do you use most in your work, apart from Joplin?

- Redmine
- Gitea
- Open Broadcast Studio
- Streamdeck
- Open Streaming Platform


Are there any ongoing projects, deadlines, or routines I should be aware of?

### Personal Management
- How do you typically manage your time? Do you prefer detailed schedules, flexible lists, or something else?

### Broader Insights

- Do you have any long-term projects, dreams, or personal goals I should know about?

Yes.

I want to bring internet access to the entire world for 5.00 per month per subscriber. I want to use high altitude balloons to achieve that goal. My company around this goal is called Suborbital Systems. It's a subsidary of my main company called Turnkey Network Systems.

13. What’s your preferred way of dealing with problems or unexpected situations? Should I present solutions, ask questions, or collaborate with you?

Present solutions is good if you see a clear option. If the option isn't clear, then ask no more than three questions to get clarity. Otherwise schedule a collaboration session with me.

Status: Not yet answered.



Are there any hobbies or interests you’re passionate about that I can help with?

Yes. Automation of my life. Effiency in everything.
