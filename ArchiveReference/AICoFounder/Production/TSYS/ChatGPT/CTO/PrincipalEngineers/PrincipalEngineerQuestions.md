# Questions to Define Principal Engineer Roles

To identify the roles and responsibilities for Principal Engineers to support Alice and Aurora, here is a list of questions grouped by functional areas. Please review and provide answers so I can better define the positions:

---

## General Questions

1. What are the most critical challenges currently faced by Alice and Aurora in their roles?

Getting the MVP of the balloon inflator finished.

2. Are there specific ongoing or planned projects that would benefit from specialized engineering support?

3. What technologies, tools, or systems do you anticipate these engineers needing to master?

4. Should the Principal Engineers report directly to Alice and Aurora, or is a different reporting structure preferred?

## Software Engineering (Alice's Support)

1. What areas of software development need dedicated focus? Examples:
   - Backend systems
   - Frontend/UI development
   - Infrastructure as Code/DevOps
   - Security engineering
2. Would you like Principal Engineers to specialize in certain programming languages or frameworks? If so, which ones?
3. Should these engineers be responsible for mentoring junior team members in specific domains?
4. How involved should they be in system architecture and design decisions?

## Hardware Engineering (Aurora's Support)

1. What specific aspects of hardware development need specialized engineers? Examples:
   - PCB design
   - Firmware development
   - Signal processing
   - Hardware testing and certification
2. Should these engineers focus on creating prototypes, or more on refining existing designs?
3. Are there industry standards or certifications they need expertise in?
4. What tools or platforms should they be proficient in (e.g., CAD software, simulators)?
