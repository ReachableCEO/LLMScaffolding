# Ai CoFounder

## Introduction

As Chief Technology And  Product Officer of TSYS Group / soloprenuer , I am always interested in leveraging every asset possible, conserving capital and
having solid velocity multipliers.

This repository captures my efforts at filling VP roles in my organization using generative AI:

(Svp roles are reporting to me directly)
(Vp roles are reporting to corresponding Svp)
(so i need to be able to tell my directs (via Redmine ticket) to do something, and then they would direct their team to execute). All communication will happen via Redmine tickets.

- SVpMarketing
- SVpSales
- VpSales(region)

- SvpProduct

- SVpEngineering
- VpHardware
- VpSoftare

(VP reporting to (currently unfilled, i'm the interim) Chief Operating Officer)

- VpCompliance
- VpPeople

I suppose this should be called "AI First Hires" but it's kind of a co-founder of sorts...

I am embarking on this journey in earnest 1/1/2025. 

Stay tuned.
